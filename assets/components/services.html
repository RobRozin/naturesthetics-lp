          <p>
            The consultation takes place online via any messenger that’s
            convenient for you. After you’ve made the payment, I’ll send you a
            questionnaire with detailed questions to answer. I’ll also ask for
            clear photos of your face and your current skincare products.
          </p>
          <p>
            If needed, I may follow up with a few extra questions to ensure I
            have a complete picture of your skin’s condition and needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all the information is collected, I’ll carefully analyze it and
            build a personalized skincare plan tailored specifically to your
            skin type, concerns, and goals. When selecting products, I always
            take your budget into account to make sure your routine is both
            effective and financially comfortable.
          </p>
          <p>

          Can an online consultation be effective?

            Yes, an online consultation can be very effective. To assess the
            condition of your skin, all I need is a clear, high-quality photo of
            your face without makeup (no worries – today, phones can take great
            pictures!). It's also crucial to ask the right questions, which is
            why I send a detailed questionnaire for you to fill out. By
            reviewing your responses and photos, I can create an accurate
            understanding of your skin and recommend a personalized skincare
            routine.

            I do not work with specific brands. I focus on recommending the most
            effective products based on your skin's needs and your budget, not
            brand names or marketing promises. After the consultation, I'll
            provide you with links to purchase the recommended products online
            or in stores.

            It’s possible, though rare, to have an individual intolerance to a

          Why should I purchase a consultation if estheticians offer free
          skincare recommendations?
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-3 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <p>
            Estheticians typically recommend products from brands they have
            agreements with, earning a commission on each sale.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my experience, many estheticians lack a deep understanding of
            cosmetic chemistry, which means their product recommendations are
            often based on personal observations rather than ingredient
            analysis. What works for one person may not work for another because
            everyone’s skin is unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, estheticians who are not trained to read ingredient
            labels often rely on what they’ve been taught during training or on
            the product descriptions on the packaging. But, as you might know,
            packaging descriptions can be misleading, as every brand promotes
            its products in the best possible light. The only reliable source of
            information is the ingredients list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people believe that products prescribed by estheticians are
            more effective because they are labeled as "professional." However,
            this is a myth. Officially, there is no category of "professional
            skincare products." All home-care products are classified as
            "cosmetics," meaning the percentage of active ingredients is capped
            by law. Therefore, these products are no more effective than those
            available in retail stores.
